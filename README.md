# Modified Grover’s Algorithm (Long 2001) with PennyLane 🔍🧠

This repository provides an implementation of the **modified Grover’s algorithm** proposed by **G. L. Long (2001)**, which introduces **phase matching** to improve the success probability of finding the marked state. The algorithm is implemented using [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/), a powerful library for quantum computing and hybrid quantum-classical ML.
